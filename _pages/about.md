* Hello, I'm Caoyi Liu!
<br>
* I'm an undergraduate from Wuhan University in China. I major in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics ( Strengthening Basic Disciplines Program) and have a strong interest in Computational Mathematics.
<br>
*Recently I have been focusing on Numerical Solutions for Partial Differential Equations. I'm both interested in some traditional methods like Spectral Method, Finite Element Method, Finite Volume Method and modern algorithms such as JKO scheme, Primal-Dual method and so on.
